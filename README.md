# Eigenfaces
Scratch implementation of PCA (eigenfaces for face recognition)

Opencv haarcascade is used for face detection and cropping after that eigenfaces is used for face recognition. Eigenface is implemented using numpy.


Note: while training data sometime the eigenvalues come as complex number so one can remove some unfit training images manually to get the real eigenvalues
